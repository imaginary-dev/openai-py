        """
        Creates a completion for the provided prompt and parameters.

        Args:
          model: ID of the model to use. You can use the
              [List models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/models/list) API to
              see all of your available models, or see our
              [Model overview](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview) for
              descriptions of them.

          prompt: The prompt(s) to generate completions for, encoded as a string, array of
              strings, array of tokens, or array of token arrays.

              Note that <|endoftext|> is the document separator that the model sees during
              training, so if a prompt is not specified the model will generate as if from the
              beginning of a new document.

          best_of: Generates `best_of` completions server-side and returns the "best" (the one with
              the highest log probability per token). Results cannot be streamed.

              When used with `n`, `best_of` controls the number of candidate completions and
              `n` specifies how many to return â€“ `best_of` must be greater than `n`.

              **Note:** Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly
              consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable
              settings for `max_tokens` and `stop`.

          echo: Echo back the prompt in addition to the completion

          frequency_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their
              existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to
              repeat the same line verbatim.

              [See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/parameter-details)

          logit_bias: Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

              Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the GPT
              tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You can use this
              [tokenizer tool](/tokenizer?view=bpe) (which works for both GPT-2 and GPT-3) to
              convert text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits
              generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model,
              but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection;
              values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the
              relevant token.

              As an example, you can pass `{"50256": -100}` to prevent the <|endoftext|> token
              from being generated.

          logprobs: Include the log probabilities on the `logprobs` most likely tokens, as well the
              chosen tokens. For example, if `logprobs` is 5, the API will return a list of
              the 5 most likely tokens. The API will always return the `logprob` of the
              sampled token, so there may be up to `logprobs+1` elements in the response.

              The maximum value for `logprobs` is 5.

          max_tokens: The maximum number of [tokens](/tokenizer) to generate in the completion.

              The token count of your prompt plus `max_tokens` cannot exceed the model's
              context length.
              [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken)
              for counting tokens.

          n: How many completions to generate for each prompt.

              **Note:** Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly
              consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable
              settings for `max_tokens` and `stop`.

          presence_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
              whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to
              talk about new topics.

              [See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/parameter-details)

          seed: If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically,
              such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should return
              the same result.

              Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the `system_fingerprint`
              response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.

          stop: Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The
              returned text will not contain the stop sequence.

          stream: Whether to stream back partial progress. If set, tokens will be sent as
              data-only
              [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format)
              as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]`
              message.
              [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_stream_completions).

          suffix: The suffix that comes after a completion of inserted text.

          temperature: What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will
              make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more
              focused and deterministic.

              We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.

          top_p: An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the
              model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1
              means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

              We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.

          user: A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor
              and detect abuse.

              [Model overview](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview) for
              descriptions of them.

          prompt: The prompt(s) to generate completions for, encoded as a string, array of
              strings, array of tokens, or array of token arrays.

              Note that <|endoftext|> is the document separator that the model sees during
              training, so if a prompt is not specified the model will generate as if from the
              beginning of a new document.

          stream: Whether to stream back partial progress. If set, tokens will be sent as
              data-only
              [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format)
              as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]`
              message.
              [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_stream_completions).

          best_of: Generates `best_of` completions server-side and returns the "best" (the one with
              the highest log probability per token). Results cannot be streamed.

              When used with `n`, `best_of` controls the number of candidate completions and
              `n` specifies how many to return â€“ `best_of` must be greater than `n`.

              **Note:** Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly
              consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable
              settings for `max_tokens` and `stop`.

          echo: Echo back the prompt in addition to the completion

          frequency_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their
              existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to
              repeat the same line verbatim.

              [See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/parameter-details)

          logit_bias: Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

              Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the GPT
              tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You can use this
              [tokenizer tool](/tokenizer?view=bpe) (which works for both GPT-2 and GPT-3) to
              convert text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits
              generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model,
              but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection;
              values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the
              relevant token.

              As an example, you can pass `{"50256": -100}` to prevent the <|endoftext|> token
              from being generated.

          logprobs: Include the log probabilities on the `logprobs` most likely tokens, as well the
              chosen tokens. For example, if `logprobs` is 5, the API will return a list of
              the 5 most likely tokens. The API will always return the `logprob` of the
              sampled token, so there may be up to `logprobs+1` elements in the response.

              The maximum value for `logprobs` is 5.

          max_tokens: The maximum number of [tokens](/tokenizer) to generate in the completion.

              The token count of your prompt plus `max_tokens` cannot exceed the model's
              context length.
              [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken)
              for counting tokens.

          n: How many completions to generate for each prompt.

              **Note:** Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly
              consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable
              settings for `max_tokens` and `stop`.

          presence_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
              whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to
              talk about new topics.

              [See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/parameter-details)

          seed: If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically,
              such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should return
              the same result.

              Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the `system_fingerprint`
              response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.

          stop: Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The
              returned text will not contain the stop sequence.

          suffix: The suffix that comes after a completion of inserted text.

          temperature: What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will
              make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more
              focused and deterministic.

              We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.

          top_p: An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the
              model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1
              means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

              We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.

          user: A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor
              and detect abuse.
